\begin{frame}[c]{Conclusions and outlook}
    Conclusions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have developed and online adaptation algorithm using GPU-MC
		\item The algorithm is able to recover good plan quality
		\item This tool might be useful to allow uncertainty margin reduction
	\end{itemize}

	Future work:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improve spot selection
        \item Flexible number of particles per spot in gPMC
        \item Compare against robust optimization
        \item Include uncertainties
    \end{itemize}
